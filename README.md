# ShakeIt_Public
Shake It is an interactive art exhibition, which is based on my Smart juggling balls and a 3d printed lamp stand filled with LED`s. Shake It was developed for the Jerusalem mini maker faire. The art exhibition is intended to demonstrate light color mixing to children and then reward them with an interactive light game.
